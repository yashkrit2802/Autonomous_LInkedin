# Autonomous_Linkedin-
The goal is to develop an autonomous AI agent for personal branding on LinkedIn. The agent should research, create, and post content to a user's LinkedIn profile. This project is designed to assess your ability to build intelligent systems that can understand user contexts, generate engaging content, and automate social media workflows.
